Designed and implemented a relational database for an online bookstore using SQL, featuring 5 normalized tables with 4 columns each. Demonstrated core SQL skills including complex joins, subqueries, window functions, and unions to analyze book sales, customer behavior, and review ratings. The project highlights my ability to create efficient database structures and write optimized queries for real-world business insights.
